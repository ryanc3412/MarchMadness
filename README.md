# MarchMadness

MarchMadness This is a simple program that allows the user to auto-fill a march madness bracket. They can choose a random auto-fill, a seed-based probability auto-fill, or a historical based probability auto-fill. It is an easy to use program, prompting you through the process as you run it.

Bugs: One bug is the historical based probability. I don't know how to figure all the statistics so I did my best in a short time. It does take into consideration a lot of different factors so it isn't the best but it's alright. I got the probabilities that I use from a random website so who knows if they are even accurate lol. Looking to fix one day when I can go through all the statistics
